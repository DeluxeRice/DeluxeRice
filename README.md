## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Bryce, an aspiring programmer and currently a second year CS student at UCI. Although many shy away from the technical mess that is coding, I love the problem solving aspect that comes with designing and creating a program. From concept to inception, figuring out how everything should work, and then making everything work, in a project is like solving a complex puzzle. Although I don't have much in terms of a portfolio at the moment, that will soon change!**
